# üëã Hi there, welcome to my Github Profile
My name is Daniel Kings, I'm a ***Full Stack Web3 App Developer*** 

Currently working as main web3 developer of Enderchain, a blazing fast blockchain on top of Cosmos Network that I created in my free time.
I offer freelance services, sometimes accept part-time contracts or remote positions. You can find more about that in my website.

***Main Areas Of Knowledge as Developer:***
-	Development of websites using MERN Stack since 2022. Started to use NextJs in 2023 for better results and for simplicity sake. Solid experience with MongoDB, Graphql and NodeJs but I also have strong knowledge of SQL Databases like PosgreSQL and some experience using Redis Cache in a few freelancer projects.
-	Huge fan of React, my own website is created with it. Also I have good experience using Vue and a pretty good still basic knowledge of Svelte.
-	Good coding experience with JavaScript and Typescript, probably more skilled in the second one cause I used it in a daily basis to save time debugging.  
-	Great knowledge about many CSS frameworks like Bootstrap 5, Tailwind, Bulma and the best of all SASS which I use much more in personal projects.
-	I have worked many times with jQuery, Helmjs, D3js, PassportJs but my knowledge of JavaScript libraries is not limited to those above. 
-	Good experience developing mobile apps with Flutter and React Native since 2022. I have good knowledge of Electron and Ionic but not a huge fan of it. 
-	Great lover of Python and Django with pretty good experience in machine learning and data science libraries like TensorFlow, Seaborne, Pandas, Matploitlib and Numpy. I know python since 2016 but I use more JavaScript.

-	Working with Docker from 2019 and managing Kubernetes in production since 2021 on my own servers. Also I need to mention that I have good experience using software like Git, Ansible, Selenium for automated testing and Jenkins for CI/CD integration.

I'm currently interested on improve my skills with Figma and others design tools. I'm very interested in learn more about UX/UI design because I'm a very creative person who loves the visually appealing websites and I always had like a preference for the front-end part of the business.
