üëã Hi,there and welcome to my Github profile my name is Daniel Kings and I'm a full stack web3 app developer.

***Main Areas Of Knowledge as Developer:***
-	Development of websites using MERN Stack since 2022. Started to use NextJs in 2023 for better results and for simplicity sake. Solid experience with MongoDB, Graphql and NodeJs but I also have strong knowledge of SQL Databases like PosgreSQL and some experience using Redis Cache in a few freelancer projects.
-	Huge fan of React, my own website is created with it. Also I have good experience using Vue and a pretty good still basic knowledge of Svelte.
-	Good coding experience with JavaScript and Typescript, probably more skilled in the second one cause I used it in a daily basis to save time debugging.  
-	Great knowledge about many CSS frameworks like Bootstrap 5, Tailwind, Bulma and the best of all SASS which I use much more in personal projects.
-	I have worked many times with jQuery, Helmjs, D3js, PassportJs but my knowledge of JavaScript libraries is not limited to those above. 
-	Good experience developing mobile apps with Flutter and React Native since 2022. I have good knowledge of Electron and Ionic but not a huge fan of it. 
-	Great lover of Python and Django with pretty good experience in machine learning and data science libraries like TensorFlow, Seaborne, Pandas, Matploitlib and Numpy. I know python since 2016 but I use more JavaScript.
-	Good knowledge about new technologies in general, about responsive design and responsive mobile design. I have a good experience working with Figma and Adobe XD and currently very interested in learn more about UX/UI design.
-	Working with Docker from 2019 and managing Kubernetes in production since 2021 on my own servers. Also mention good experience using software like Git, Ansible, Selenium for automated testing and Jenkins for CI/CD integration.
